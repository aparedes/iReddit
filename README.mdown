Build Instructions
==================

You'll need to use at least version 4.3 of the iPhone SDK

iReddit requires Pocket and DTCoreText to build.

In the project directory simply run the following command to retrieve the submodules:

	git submodule update --init

You should then be able to build iReddit.
